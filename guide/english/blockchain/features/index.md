## Features of Blockchain Technology

The blockchain word refers to the data validation system used by the bitcoin network.
This is a p2p network of computers of global reach, and that for several years has become the most powerful in the world in computing capacity.

It's purpose is to keep a distributed transaction log, thus guaranteeing its resilience and absence of errors.
To achieve this, it uses a system of incentives and economic penalties not supported in any currency or external variable, but in parameters of the network such as reward, difficulty of calculation, cost of securing the validation equipment (also called miners), price of electricity and others.

 These qualities of the network make bitcoin the currency of the bitcoin payment network, created by a person or group of people, (and I say this because the true identity of the creator is unknown) who frequented the cryptography forums with the alias of satoshi nakamoto; is only the first available application of this technology, and allows us to think of it as what the full-time speaker and lecturer @aantonop, has defined the fifth internet protocol ---- The trust protocol of value transfer or Trust, because at the end of everything that represents money or value today but a mere abstraction that represents trust.
 
Blockchain is a decentralized technology, for design needs, because the purpose with which it was created was to offer an alternative to the current economic system, based on the FIAT money, created through debt and financial leverage, let's put ourselves in context year 2008 - beginning of the economic crisis.

Another sinequanone condition is that it be open source, and I will try to develop this.

 Bitcoin from now on BTC, it is not a company, where you need to open a user account with password and password, in fact in the BTC network there are no people in charge of its development or of any tasks, it works by the mechanics of the projects and the philosophy of the OPEN code, this means that anyone can read the code, so if you execute it, you are already joining its network and accepting its rules because this means executing its code, this is the reason that it must necessarily be Open Source.
 
Also like any open source project, it allows you to improve it and forke it if you do not agree with something, it is the rest of the users of the network who, with the execution of your code, will give you or take away your authority or acceptance.h.

#### _* Decentralized System_


When something is controlled by a central authority, where the power to make decision lies in the hands of the apex of the management, such system is called a Centralized System. Banks, for example, are a centralized system, where it's the responsibility of the Governor to make decisions.

On the contrary, when the power is vested in the hands of the people or the users, such system is said to be a Decentralized System.
The peer to peer network, Torrent, for example is a decentralised system, where the user has complete control.

#### _* Distributed Ledger_

> Blockchains use distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) to store and access the data around.

When something is stored on a Distributed Ledger, multiple copies of it are made across the network at the same time. Unlike traditional databases, distributed ledger do not have a central database or administration functionality.

When applied in a decentralized system like Blockchain, each user has a copy of the ledger and participates in the transaction verification. This gives Blockchain the property of Immutability and ensures security. Since, the data is distributed, there is no centralized version of the data for the hackers to corrupt. The data and the records are public and easily verifiable. This also eliminates single point of Failure.

#### _* Secure Ecosystem (Cryptographic Hash)_

BlockTech uses the concepts like Proof of Work and Hash encryption to ensure security and immutability. Proof of work involves several people around the world using computational algorithm to try and find the appropriate hash value that satisfies a predefined condition regarding the hash value.

#### _* Mining_

Torrent is a peer-to-peer decentralized network used to share files. Blockchain uses similar technology. What differentiates the two is that, in Torrent, the system relies on the honor code of the users to seed the files. Whereas, in blockchain, the users who are involved in the transaction have economic incentives. These users are called "Miners". The Miners spend their computing resources to solve the cryptographic hashes and ensure immutability and reliability of the transaction. Every successful solution (decryption) ensures some economic benefit - meaning the miner gets currency credited to their wallet.

#### _* Chronological and Time stamped_

Blockchains, ideally, are just very sophisticated linked lists where each block is a repository that stores information pertaining to a transaction and also links to the previous block in the same transaction. These blocks are arranged in an order and are time-stamped during creation to ensure a fair record.

#### _* Consensus Based_

Consensus Based is an approach to decision making. It is a creative and dynamic way of reaching agreement between all members of a group. A transaction on Blockchain can be executed only if all the parties on the network unanimously approve it. It is however, subjected to alterations to suit various circumstances.
